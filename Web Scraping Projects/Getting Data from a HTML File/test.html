        <p> Attention all epic gamers. We have to unite to dab on dem haters and floss. Tiktok is taking over - our cars are exloding, birds are exploding, and most importantly: our rotten chicken wings in the bath tub are exploding. Tiktok-ers can only be stopped one way: through starting an ice age. Not made of water, but made of lemonade (hey, that almost rhymed). On the 1st of April 2020, we will rise up and fly BOEING 747s to the U.S. (their source) with over 3L of lemonade</p>

        <p> BREAKING NEWS: over 2,00,0000 pandas have been found dead in Build-A-Bear, Dublin. Several police officers noted that over 2 incidents have been reported since 1783. Reports stated that empty panda skins were brutally stuffed with cotton and fabric hearts before given to young unaware children, who hugged them to death in less than 5 minutes. All children under the age of 7 are now prohibited, and will be sent to prison with harsh jail sentences (2 and a half seconds, or more). Everyone else is advised to stay in the safety of their houses until further notice.</p>
